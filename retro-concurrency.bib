abstract = { Algebraic effect handlers, introduced by Plotkin and Power in 2002, are recently gaining in popularity as a purely functional approach to modeling effects. In this article, we give a full overview of practical algebraic effects in the context of a compiled implementation in the Koka language. In particular, we show how algebraic effects generalize over common constructs like exception handling, state, iterators and async-await. We give an effective type inference algorithm based on extensible effect rows using scoped labels, and a direct operational semantics. Finally, we show an efficient compilation scheme to common runtime platforms (like JavaScript) using a type directed selective CPS translation. },

abstract = { The maturation of the Web platform has given rise to sophisticated and demanding Web applications such as interactive 3D visualization, audio and video software, and games. With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target.  Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations. },

The implementation eliminates the copying overhead for one-shot continuations that is inherent in multi-shot continuations.},
